## Arrays
# 1) [zero_shift_to_end](https://github.com/MehulSaini/Arrays/blob/31c0e6c13b103f4127cf60a7417dd849a9a6685b/zero_shift_to_end.cpp)
program used to take input of a ten-element array and give an output of an array with all the zeroes shifted to the end.
eg. A = [1,2,3,4,0,0,5,6,7,8]
output = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,0]

# 2) [smallest_and_largest](https://github.com/MehulSaini/Arrays/blob/dc3e532519ce2fac55d85fe5406946393fbdf45b/smallest_and_largest.cpp):
program used to take input of a ten-element array and give an output of the smallest and largest element in it.
eg. A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]
output = smallest = 0
largest = 9

# 3)[repetition_of_element](https://github.com/MehulSaini/Arrays/blob/4ba9c7995e57d31336d9690238353d7a3709319a/repetition_of_element.cpp):
program used to take input of a ten-element array and give an output of elements repeating in it and how many times they repeat.
eg. A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,9]
output = 8 is repeating 2 times

# 4)[peak_values](https://github.com/MehulSaini/Arrays/blob/f46d48c69baf62f94fba4a81959d39979ce99a8a/peak_values.cpp):
program used to take input of a ten-element array and give an output values which are at peak i.e neighbouring elements are lower in value.
eg. A = [1,2,3,4,3,5,4,6,7,8]
output = 4 5

#5) [print_array](https://github.com/MehulSaini/Arrays/blob/6f3314baa8a85990bc1402842f198e722c6d8a8d/print_array.cpp):
program used to take input of a ten-element array and print it out as it is.
